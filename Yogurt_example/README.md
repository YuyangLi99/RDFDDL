# Jena State Reasoner
This project uses Apache Jena to implement four reasoning rules demonstrated with a yogurt manufacturing example. The main Java classes are:

- `IsNextBuiltin.java`
- `ModeChange.java`
- `ModeChange2.java`
- `ModeChange3.java`
- `ModeChange4.java`

- Auxiliary classes: `RDFPostProcessor.java`, `Prove_helper.java`
- `Prove_helper.java` Sends a request to KeymaeraX, fetches and interprets the result
- `RDFPostProcessor.java` Converting generic state relationships (next, ModeChange, ModeChange2,ModeChange3, ModeChange4) into more specific descriptive relationships.

The test and validation classes are located in the `test` directory:
- `IsNextBuiltinTest.java`: Runs the five reasoning rules.

Any RDF generated by the reasoning process is saved in the `resources` folder (e.g., `test/resources/`).
There are 2 '.ttl' files in the resources folder: 
- `knowledgeGraphWithSHACL_original2.ttl` is the output RDF without changing the relationships' names with `RDFPostProcessor.java`
- `knowledgeGraphWithSHACL_processed2.ttl` is the final output RDF file.
