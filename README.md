# RDFdL: Integrating RDF with Differential Dynamic Logic

This repository implements the **RDFdL Verification Pipeline**, connecting RDF/SHACL modeling with differential dynamic logic (dL) proofs to model and validate Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in a mathematically guaranteed way.

## 1. Project Introduction 

The core of this project is the **"RDFdL Verification Pipeline"**, which operates as follows:

1.  **Modeling with RDF/SHACL**: We model a Cyber-Physical Systemâ€”its components, states, and physical constraintsâ€”using the Resource Description Framework (RDF). The Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) is used to define the precise rules and conditions for each state.
<<<<<<< HEAD
2.  **SHACL Validation**: Before inferring any transitions, each RDF state is checked against its SHACL shape (`Validation.java`). This ensures no invalid state (one that violates the predefined constraints) enters the reasoning or proof stages.
3.  **Reasoning with Jena**: The Apache Jena framework is used to reason the validated RDF graph and propose potential state transitions based on the systemâ€™s logic (e.g., continuous evolution or mode switches). These inferences are added as candidate triples (e.g., `ex:next`, `ex:ModeChange`).
4.  **Proof with KeYmaera X**: For each inferred transition, the system generates a formal proof obligation expressed in Differential Dynamic Logic (dL). This proof is sent to the **KeYmaera X** theorem prover for validation.
5.  **Verified State Graph**: A transition is only accepted and added to the final knowledge graph if KeYmaera X successfully proves its logical correctness. The final output is a fully verified state-transition graph of the hybrid system.

2.  **Reasoning with Jena**: The Apache Jena framework is used to examine the validated RDF graph and propose potential state transitions based on the systemâ€™s logic (e.g., continuous evolution or mode switches). These inferences are added as candidate triples (e.g., `ex:next`, `ex:ModeChange`).
3.  **Proof with KeYmaera X**: For each inferred transition, the system generates a formal proof obligation expressed in Differential Dynamic Logic (dL). This proof is sent to the **KeYmaera X** theorem prover for validation.
4.  **Verified State Graph**:    The final output is an RDF graph in which every transition edge is backed by a successful dL proof, producing a fully verified hybrid-system state machine.

This approach ensures that the CPS model is both semantically rich (via RDF/SHACL) and formally safe (via KeYmaera X proofs).

## 2. Modules Overview 

This repository contains two examples to demonstrate the RDFdL pipeline:

* **`Yogurt_example/`**: A multi-stage yogurt manufacturing process. Involves multiple devices (heater, homogenizer, pasteurizer, cooler) and showcases cross-device handoffs and multi-mode transitions.
* **`Oven_cake/`**: A single-device example: an industrial oven controlling temperature. Models heating and cooling dynamics and infers transitions between four discrete states (two modes Ã— two temperature regions).

## 3. Running Each Example ðŸš€

#### Yogurt Example 

* **Test Entry Point**: `Yogurt_example/src/test/java/IsNextBuiltinTest.java`
* **SHACL Validation**: `Yogurt_example/src/test/java/Validation.java` checks each state against SHACL shapes. Run separately with:  
  ```bash
  mvn test -pl Yogurt_example -Dtest=Validation
* **To Run**: The test automatically executes all reasoning rules, generating two TTL output files: one with the original inferred relations and one that is post-processed with more descriptive relationship names.
* **To Verify**: If you wish to verify a transition in KeYmaera X, you can use the `Prove_helper.java` class, which constructs and sends the dL proof requests.

#### Oven Example 

* **Test Entry Point**: `Oven_cake/src/test/java/IsNextBuiltinTest.java`
* **SHACL Validation**: `Oven_cake/src/test/java/Validation.java` checks each state against SHACL shapes. Run separately with:  
  ```bash
  mvn test -pl Oven_cake -Dtest=Validation
* **To Run**: Running this test generates the `knowledgeGraphWithSHACL_oven_safe_processed.ttl` file, which contains the final, inferred state-transition graph.
* **To Verify**: To validate the oven's temperature control safety properties, the dL script generated via `Prove_helper.java` can be imported into KeYmaera X for analysis.

## 4. Quick Start Guide âš¡

#### Prerequisites
* **Java**: Version 11+ (the project is configured for 23)
* **Maven**: To build the project.
* **KeYmaera X**: v5.0.1 for formal verification.
* **Wolfram Engine**: v13.1, as an ODE solver for KeYmaera X.

#### Build & Test Commands
From the root directory (`RDFDDL-main/`), run the following commands:

```bash
# Build all modules
 
mvn clean install

# Run the Yogurt example test specifically
mvn test -pl Yogurt_example -Dtest=IsNextBuiltinTest

# Run the Oven example test specifically
mvn test -pl Oven_cake -Dtest=IsNextBuiltinTest
